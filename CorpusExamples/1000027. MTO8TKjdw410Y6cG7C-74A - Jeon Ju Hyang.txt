Came here with a group of friends for some quick lunch. This place has been around my neighbourhood for some time. Somehow we managed to fit 16 people in the restaurant. Anyway, we ordered our food and not long after all the appetizer dishes came right out. I still think that's the best part of the meal. I was looking over their menu, and realized there's too many choices and so I played it safe by ordering a fried rice. It was... okay? Big portion but the taste is just... okay. There's nothing thrilling about it. Will I come back? Maybe a lot of convincing from my friends.
